Multiple changes are needed to get the Solar charger into a working solution:

Due to the fact that the solar panel max. current is about 10mA it makes some changes
in the design to be made. The booster to bring up the voltage to 5V needs more power
at the solar panel side than it can deliver.

First decission: the booster should bring the voltage up to the 3.3V rail instead of
the 5V rail.

The inspection of the running circuit reveals these numbers:

- The buck converter needs as much as 6mA (> 0.8V) at the input to change from
  the non-effissient Start-Up mode to the MPPT-mode.

- When running MPPT-mode, the current consumption drops to less than 2mA.


The solar panel itself brings abt. 5 mA in the August afternoon-sun (5pm).

As a result the solar power circuit would be active only when 3.3V are already
present on the out-ports of the converter. Otherwise it needs summer light at high noon
to get the thing running, what is in most cases not so.


Second decission: a wire to board connectors should be placed instead of the
solar panel itself to be more flexible.
